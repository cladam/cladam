👋 Hi, I’m Claes Adamsson (@cladam)

I'm an experienced IT Professional with skills in Software Development, Architecture, and System Engineering. I'm a strong proponent of DevOps principles and a believer in Cloud Technology, always looking for ways to help teams work better together.

🌱 What I’m Working On

I'm currently focused on building open-source developer tools that codify best practices and streamline common workflows. My goal is to create "friendly assistants" that reduce friction and make the right way the easy way.

My main projects right now are:

[tbdflow](https://github.): A CLI written in Rust to streamline and safeguard Git workflows for teams practicing Trunk-Based Development.


👀 I’m interested in...

Trunk-Based Development and Continuous Integration

Developer Experience (DevEx) and workflow automation

Building robust and ergonomic CLI tools in Rust

Programming in Kotlin

Exploring Lean and XP methodologies in software engineering

All things DevOps, its culture, practises and tools

Team development

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...

I'm always open to collaborating on tools that improve the lives of developers. If you're interested in TBD, DevOps, or have ideas for new CLIs, feel free to open an issue or reach out!
