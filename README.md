# 👋 Hi, I’m Claes Adamsson (@cladam)

I'm an experienced IT Professional (since late nineties) from southern Sweden. I like to design, architect and build things.

## What I’m Working On

I'm currently focused on building open-source developer tools that codify best practices and streamline common workflows. My goal is to create "friendly assistants" that reduce friction and make the right way the easy way.

## My main projects right now are:

[tbdflow](https://github.com/cladam/tbdflow): A CLI written in Rust to streamline and safeguard Git workflows for teams practicing Trunk-Based Development.


## I’m interested in...

* Trunk-Based Development and Continuous Integration
* Developer Experience (DevEx) and workflow automation
* Building robust and ergonomic CLI tools in Rust
* Programming in Kotlin
* Programming in Rust
* Exploring Lean and XP methodologies in software engineering
* All things DevOps, its culture, practises and tools
* Team development

## I’m looking to collaborate on...

I'm always open to collaborating on tools that improve the lives of developers. If you're interested in TBD, DevOps, or have ideas for new CLIs, feel free to open an issue or reach out!
